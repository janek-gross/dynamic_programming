# dynamic_programming
This repository contains simple implementation of the popular dynamic programming algorithms policy iteration and value iteration. The algorithms are demonstrated on a simpe maze task. The agent receives different rewards per step in the maze. State-transitions are subject to noise. The algorithms compute the optimal actions for each cell.
